<p>
Datasets are curated by those who have already analysed it and then share it for you to analyse. There is not much fun in that. The challenge lies in taking real world data and then cleaning it.
</p>
<p>    
Look around you and see where some good data can be collected or is already available. Then work on that Some data might need scraping, another might need wrangling and munging the data. Think about these aspects after you collect the data.
</p>
<p>    
If you still need the curated data, then head to kaggle, observable and dagshub. There are lots of data available. Have a funtime.
