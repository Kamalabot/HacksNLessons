<h1>Start by actually writing code on your computer notepad and executing the code on the compiler. </h1>

<p>That is how you can start learning. I had spent countless hours watching videos and lectures. Sleeping, Eating and Doing various things when the videos were running. Except, I wasn’t coding. Coding is a very involved, and “go all out activity”. So gets your hands dirty and start coding.</p>
<p>That is why, I shared where to practice first. Most of these sites have environment (IDEs) where you can type code, execute it and get results. If you don’t have a swimming pool, then you are not going to learn swimming. Same way, If you have an environment where you can test your code, then you are going to learn coding. Very Fast…</p>
<p>Okay.. but Where to learn???</p>
<p>Everyone has become a teacher(me too, ha ha…) If one commodity is in surplus in this world right now then it is teachers. Teachers are not only creative and teach others, they are learning themselves rapidly. They write blogs, quora answers, create videos and then finally use those contents and release a book. All this they are doing by learning something new. They are having all the fun…(Some smart teachers, write programs to scrape the answers from various locations, and create new website, just by doing magic on keyboards!!!)</p>
<p>Because, they learnt the language the hard way!!! So learn like a Teacher. A teacher loves learning. Shear love of learning transforms into love for teaching. The moment you think of teaching a language to someone else, you will want to be more informed, knowledgeable, practice more, try new techniques. The motivation is ever lasting. Okay, Motivation check…. Practice Check….</p>
<p>But I have not yet told “Where to learn???”</p>
<p>You learn from other programmers. Not by their tutoring but by reading their code. You learn by seeing how they have solved a particular problem and understand the solution, improve it further and see if you can break it. You learn more by copying (you type the code, not copy and paste) others’ code and getting it executed in the way you want. A good coder reads a lot of codes. Search for ways to read a lot of code. An artist is trained by repeatedly copying the master’s masterpiece. You have to become apprentice of master programmers.</p>
<p>Online content is divided into two types. One solves a problem you have. Another type of content teaches you how to use the solution(This answer is the 2nd type of content). Both these content don’t really take you deep into a language workings, and concepts. Some of the programmers are kind enough and written many books. There are publishing houses that are famous for such programming books. Search there and you will find a treasure trove of books, with examples and exercises. You have to sit with each book, its exercises and complete them strictly.</p>
<p>(I learnt the above idea of “learning programming the hardway” from one such book. It changed the way I look at the cyber and physical world. I am greatful to that author.)</p>
<p>There you have the pattern that needs to be followed by learning to program. Practice, Teach, Read and Repeat. Rest you will figure out as you go. All the best…</p>
