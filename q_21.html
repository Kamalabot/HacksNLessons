<h1>There are many ways to implement</h1>

<p>The most important among them is programmatically doing mechanical design. Autocad, the 1st tool all the Mech guys learn, can be accessed with the Pyautocad library. Take a peek here</p>

There will be lot of measurements and testing during design and in manufacturing. Various sensors can be extended from a simple Raspberry Pi and the data captured can be piped into D3.js charting library in Java Script. Take a look at it here. Whether it is temperature of tool, or CNC machine status, its data can be used</p>

Take manufacturing itself. The CNC machines are very costly and complicated machines. How can a programmer individually program those complicated controls. No, you are not alone. Many of the Mechanical guys have taken to programming and created supporting libraries like the PyCnC below.</p>

Look at the below website that shows how the tool path can be visualised from the GCode. Whats more, the code is open source. If you are keen on improving these programs, all you need is problem solving skills and good programming skills. This tool is coded in Java Script.</p>

I have just touched only the manufacturing aspect. For Robotics there is so many libraries, there are books written on this single topic. There is operations, planning, costing where there are libraries which can implemented for specific and repetitive tasks. Then there is machine learning libraries that can do lot more than regular algorithms. Also the Computer Vision and Natural language programming.</p>
Also I just gave 2 examples for each, Python and JavaScript. There are implementation in C, C++, Rust etc. But these languages work on writing programs that are super efficient both in time and memory. Have a great time imagining new uss for using programming in Mechanical design.</p>
