<body><h1>It depends on which stage of Pythonic Evolution you are currently undergoing.</h1>

<p> you master the language, all you need is a python terminal to type the python code to solve the problems.</p>

<p>Unbelievable!!! Lets take an example. The below function “Moving Zeros”, how many lines the code can be???</p>
<div>
moving_zeros([1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3]) # has to returns [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0]  
It has a single line solution. (Not sharing solution here…)
</div>

<p>When you are going to write single line functions, and import most of the other functions from libraries, the IDEs matter less and less. Aim to master the language to a level where you can compile the program logic in your mind.</p></body>
