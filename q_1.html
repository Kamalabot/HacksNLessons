<h1>In yourself.</h1>

Importantly get a part time job to learn how the business works. Ridiculous? Think again, if you want to grow that 2L then you need discipline, exposure to people, entrepreneur mindset, risk taking ability. So start with securing a job.

Depending on your major, you may choose different businesses to work for. Your intent is on learning not earning. What you earn, save 30% and spend the remaining in seeing the world or atleast your country.

Reach out to books and read them like crazy. Target atleast 150 books a year. Spend the time on your body and mindâ€™s health.

It is a different way of growing wealth. Have a great day.
