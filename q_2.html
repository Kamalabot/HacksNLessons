    <h1>Very lucrative indeed the lure of entering the world of programming and enjoying the associated freedom.</h1>

    <div>
        Here are some of the major areas in development that anyone can target. The list is non exaustive…
        <ul>
            <li>Front and backend. Algorithm design if services are involved.</li>
            <li>Database Management. Mostly, SQL, Oracle, Bigquery</li>
            <li>Data visualisation, modeling and Machine learning. Python and R and whole lot of libraries.</li>
            <li>Devops and system management. Python, Node JS</li>
            <li>API development for any service. Many OOPS based languages.</li>
            <li>Metaverse development using Unreal 3D and Blueprint. Solidity, Rust, Unreal engine</li>
            <li>Metaverse and Blockchain using Solidity</li>
            <li>Testing and automation</li>
            <li>Web automation</li>
            <li>Microservices in payment, online worlds to enable web 3 technologies. Many languages</li>
            <li>Iphone and Windows development. Swift, Go, Visual studio</li>
            <li>The list goes on… I have not got started on the programming languages.</li>
        </ul>

            The above is a list that has good deal of opportunity. The beauty is, learning couple of programming
            languages, practicing to use the libraries and APIs is the standard process many follow. I too did the same.
            Only to realise the mistake after 2 years. ( Good that I decided not quit the job and learn in free times
            and reduce my sleep time by 2 hours. Yep, you get a lot done in that time.

            I am a mechanical engineer and I can design a Centrifugal pump and speak about 2nd law of thermodynamics,
            work on the kinematics of machines as fluently as solve programming problems. I work in sales I am sure you
            too can do such things. Here is the key TAKE AWAY, if you want design a super machine, the machine has to
            first SOLVE A PROBLEM. That is what machines do, correct?

            Programming is nothing but building machines. The For loop is Rack and Pinion arrangement. Recursion is your
            extension rod, there is even a Generator in Python which is like our Ratchet and pinion. The programming
            languages and computers are inspired by the problem like the same way how mechanisms are inspired.

            I hope you got the idea. Start by learning to solve problems using any language that is easy to you. People
            refer to Python mostly. There is Javascript, Ruby, Rust and nodeJs. They have their own libraries and online
            platforms where you can train. Even there are online platforms that can check your programs, they are called
            online judges. Search about them.

            Feel free to DM me if you have doubts. Wish you have a great career.
