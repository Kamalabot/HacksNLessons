<h1>Start by Reading Code</h1>
<ul>
<li>* Read a lot of Code that others have written. Head to visualizing data structures and algorithms through animation (http://visualgo.net)  or 
https://the-algorithms.com/* Implement Algorithms by reading the specification, and then check how it has been implemented.</li>
<li>* Solve problems using coded, even simple problems can be broken in to steps and coded from there. The book 57 programming challenges can help</li>
<li>* Take visualising data using code. This will teach you many concepts about selection, modification of the variables on the fly</li>
<li>* Share what you have created with others who are learning like you and discuss. Be open for new ideas and totally unknown ways.</li>
<li>* Maintain a list of real world problems that you want to program. Keep researching on how others have solved it.</li>
<li>* Learn about the new libraries and how to use their APIs for solving specific problems. Many times the problem you want to code is written by someone else.</li>
<li>* Start learning about the system that are working around you. Like Facebook, twitter, youtube, google maps etc. Many open source applications have the code on github. Start reading the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some repo to begin your journey by reading the code. I have included my own 57 challenges repo, which you can fork and start playing around.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer</li>
<li>https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python</li>
<li>https://github.com/Kamalabot/Programmers57Challenges</li>
<p>This is a repo that I am working currently to learn D3.js, the visualisation library for Data Analysis and presentation. I am fascinated with the level of automation this library brings in creating the HTML page element. Take a look. It is very much under development.</p>

</ul>
<p>
Then there is series of YouTube channels that you can watch where they show how the algorithms are implemented, new concepts in programming languages, new ideas that are coming up in the programming arena. Some notable channels I like are Inside code, Coding tech, devâ€™s story to name a few. Their playlists are here.

    Programming is a very important skill to have, so spend your time on it with utmost urgency. Once you start creating something, go ahead and share it with others. The above YouTube channels, the repos have started that way. Even I have shared my own at the top, so we can learn and share at the same time. </p>
