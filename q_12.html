You can go through my repo on 57 python programs and various problems that I have completed till date. 
https://github.com/Kamalabot/Programmers57Challenges.git
1. Fork the above repo and clone it to your local machine
2. Look for the **exe18_TempCon**v.py (http://v.py)
3. Learn the program, and add comments of your understanding
4. Create a list of temperatures from 5 to 25 in the intervals of 5
5. Modify the program to Convert this list of temperature to Kelvin scale and print them
    a. You can look for the function conv_temp(num:int,from_scale:str, to_scale:str) -> int: and use that.
