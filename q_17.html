    <h1>Coding is not that difficult endeavour</h1>
    <p>
        If correct training and practice is given. Future will be dominated some form coding work. So change the idea
        that coding is for some specific people… Let me explain
    </p>
    <p>
        Practice I am saying, is not for algorithms, but for visualising what the final solution will look like. Many
        lack the vision of what they want to solve or achieve. If that is known and the solution involves coding then
        the person will learn coding easily.

        That urge to build, create is there in everyone. Some are good at cooking for example and others in swimming
        etc. But, very few have mastery in the chosen field. Say making a awesome chai, takes years of practice…

        I am fascinated with the visual stories that are created using data, and wanted to create something like that. I
        learnt that, the only way is to learn coding. In that process I have learnt python in 2 years and then
        Javascript in matter 6 months. I am beginner at best, but I can read and understand the code. So, making a “cup
        of tea can be difficult, but drinking it is… yep very refreshing and eyeopening…

        How you look at coding is important. We all think coding is a solo activity, it is. To some extent. Once the
        code is written then so many people and your own future self will use and rewrite it. Coding is done with much
        concentration, then coders are open to discuss and improve on regular basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        If coding is not your cup of tea, then think of it as a cup of coffee and try it. Future will be dominated
        coding and good grasp of current technology will help you to learn fast in changing business environment. Happy
        coding.
