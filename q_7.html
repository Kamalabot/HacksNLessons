<body><h1>Men are different in the way we love. We ourselves don't know this.ðŸ˜œ</h1>

<p>Men love themselves more when they are with what they love the most, have achieved, strived to attain in their life. Does your man love himself? Can you see him happy, and making those around him happy? Is he caring towards you? If you answer yes to one of the above question, then it is time you loved him more.</p>
<p>Men usually distance themselves when they are facing some challenge and they want to solve it themselves. That is how we are made, and no we are not showing our independence. Men are designed in such a foolish blueprint, which was useful in prehistoric times. We distance ourselves and then come closer when we have resolved the issue.</p>
<p>Finally men seek solution and want to maintain the current good condition. Not change and try something new. If your guy is reluctant in this aspect, then try to cajole him and be patient.</p>
<p>Have a fun life.</p></body>
