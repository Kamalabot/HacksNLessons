<h1>I took help of Simon</h1>    
<p>Most of the problems we face are already faced by someone, and they solve it and share. In this case <a href="https://simonwhitaker.github.io/github-fork-ribbon-css/">Simon Whitaker</a> 
had a solution. All I needed to do was to point my css link route to the style in the CDN. It is done like the following </p>
<pre>
    in Head add the following in the link tab
        "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/github-fork-ribbon-css/0.2.3/gh-fork-ribbon.min.css"
    
    in Body add the following in as a href link
        class="github-fork-ribbon" href="https://github.com/Kamalabot/HacksNLessons" data-ribbon="Fork me on GitHub" title="Fork me on GitHub">
</pre>
<p>Ensure that your git repo link is updated. That is all folks.</p>
