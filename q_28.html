<h1>There are so many libraries in many languages today, for visualising data.</h1> 
<p>
The libraries and the visualisation objective are deciding which language you can use. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Python has Plotly, Altair</li>
    <li>R has Shiny</li>
    <li>JS has D3, Vega, Plot, Vega lite, and PlotlyJS</li>
    <li>There is mother of all visualisation libraries, GGplot</li>
</ul>
<p>    
Grammar of Graphics[GG] is a  way of creating the charts. Among the above the **best and easily accessible** is Observable Plot. A go to tool for visualisation. The **best and  toughest **to master is D3 but gives maximum flexibility. 
</p>
<p>
Charts are user facing products. So the color, scale, the type of plot (or in case of observable the Marks) used determine how the data is percieved. 
</p>
<p>
Allowing the user to explore the data and find the insights by themselves is another very interesting objective. 
</p>
<p>
Think about the trade off between the frameworks based on the application and decide appropriately. I will go with D3 as the best, followed by Plote In python Altair and Plotly. In R, shiny.
