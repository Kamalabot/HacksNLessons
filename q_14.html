    <h1>The CBSE curriculum has covered most important areas</h1>
    <p>
        Starting with problem solving and leaving the student equipped with installing modules and libraries. Very
        impressive.

        There are two Logical steps. Learning object oriented programming. Power of python lies in the Objects and
        design patterns. Multiple application like Data science, Game programming, audio or video processing,
        webscraping will involve objects that can make your programming task easier in real world. The objects abstract
        all the complexity and provide you an easy interface called the API.

        Another route is to master problem solving. This will be continuation to your syllabus. The problems are
        available in many online websites. Dmoj, usaco, kattis, come to my mind immediately. This route will lead you to
        understand the language better. Help you to develop efficient programming skills. The test cases under each
        problems can be challenging.

        Choose wisely. Spend atleast 2 hours a day practice programming. Use VScode IDE. Learn GIT hub and Bash
        scripting. Deep dive into Linux and familiarise yourself with file system.
