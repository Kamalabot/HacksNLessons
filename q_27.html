<h1>There is only so much code you can learn and write all by yourself.</h1> 
<p>
The frameworks and libraries reduce the redundancy created in programming and gives programmers to do what they are really good at.
</p>
<p>    
Even when you use these frameworks, you use them to bring in the data and present the data. To process the data, your competetive skills are required. 
</p>
<p>
There are unique challenges in programming in all applications. In webdev also there are areas where your skills can be utilised. There are many repetetive tasks in webdev that you can automate. Visualising data is another unique area where there is opportunity. Then there is data engineering, and data pipeline creation. 
</p>
<p>
APIs provide access to a programming resource. The interface engineering is a unique challenge, whether in data science or web dev. Then comes the 3d modeling and working in metaverse applications. Do research in these areas and see how your competetive programming skill can be used.
