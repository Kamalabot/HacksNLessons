<h1>ML is a great tool when you want find a pattern in a dataset and leverage it to make decisions.</h1>

<p>This pattern can be found when your code can look for it. That is modeling. Data science gives the model that matches this pattern. You create a model from the data given to you.</p>`
<p>How to bring the data in the production environment to the model. That is where you are facing the challenge.The front end gets the data and sends to backend. That is what you have to understand and develop for.</p>
<p>You are asked to automate the process of bringing the data to the model. There are many libraries that can help you with this. They start with Express library in JS and django library in python.</p>
<p>Django Tutorial: The Local Library website - Learn web development | MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website)</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive resource for anyone learning the art of bringing the water to horse. Your model might be top notch, but useless if it doesn't see the data. Take your time and learn the libraries. If required, then move to javascript and learn that language too.</p>
<p>As a side note try building some of the optimisation algorithms from scratch with your own implementation. This is what real data science is about. Take your time and learn. See what tools you can build and share it with the world.</p>
