<h1>Hackers learn</h1> 
<p>
the concepts of the computer science, memory, networking, assembly level shell code and have good shell scripting knowledge. There is no Programming involved in the above concepts. It is about moving the bits of 0 and 1 electronically. Algorithms are the work horse of the Hackers. Even today preferred language of Hackers is “C”.

<p>
Head over to Metasploit and read, you will get more understanding

<p>
Hacking is not programming. It is an art of knowing what the processor, program or the network will do when some command is executed. Once hacker knows that for one system, then he can replicate it as a program and spread it out. That program can be a tool (if white hat) or a virus (if black hat) depending on the purpose or vision of the tool. 
</p>
<p>
Think about it for a moment, Facebook and Instagram can be considered as a Virus and viruses like the Famed New Folder virus can be considered as a tool to understand about the computer, the networking system and shellcode. Who decides, which program is a malicious or not? In both cases, the programmer knows about the concepts so well that they can create such powerful algorithms and programs. 
</p>
<p>
Why and How the program is used decides, whether it is Hacking or plainly Getting Things Done.
</p>
<p>
If really interested in Hacking then start by researching about networks, storage, processors, mother boards, displays, connectors and connecting cables.  On the software side research about Shell Coding assembly language, exploits, debuggers, Networking Protocols, Web Browsers, Java Script, Structural and Object Oriented Programming. Take a deep breath, and learn each subject inside out.

Being an Enthusiast will take you only so far, become a fanatic and evangelist. Hope to see you the other side.
