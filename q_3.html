<h1>Fullstack is HTML, CSS, JS(Java Script), Python and SQL programming. </h1>

<p>A Full stack developer is a master of all these. That is like trying to learn German & Japanese when you are working for a MNC company. A big task when you are beginning. So the solution, Start Small.</p>

<p>Try building pages by scraping the data or by creating content and style them. It is simple, and small. Learn HTML, and CSS thoroughly. There is a book that teaches “HTML and CSS Nicely”. You will fall in love with HTML and CSS after reading it. Same author has written for JS, JQuery and Ajax too.</p>
 
<p>Work on automating the page building using JQuery as next step. JS will be used fair amount, so you will need to keep some examples handy.</p>
 
<p>Then bring in Python to automate the content creation or data delivery from a SQL database. I would suggest to use the data that are available on the net first. There are many data sources which provide you databases with data inside. You can try to build around it. Make some awesome looking protos and upload on your GIT Hub page. (Yep, add GIT to the list of tools you have to master)</p>
 
<p>The interactivity can be improved with AJAX. The CSS will help you to style the title pages and subsequent content page. The layout again is a show stopper. So go ahead take a layout that is minimal. One or two pics, good navigation, content list, links and hover color changes. Rest of the features will be addons.</p>
 
<p>When you start building small like a Lego, you will start seeing how everything works together. Then make it more complex, try breaking what you built and re-build it differently. Say, start with a different set of data in your database.</p>
 
<p>You might wonder, how the other Full Stack developers learn so fast. You know the secret is Bitter Sweet. Full Stack development is about how good you are in Problem Solving. Master Problem solving using Code. Think about algorithmic problem solving and master that. Computer speaks language of Logic and Algorithm, not English(Programming looks like English, so does Mathematics. Try reading advanced Math book, you will realize what I mean)</p>
 
<h1>What problem you are going to solve as Full Stack Developer?</h1>
 
<p>Automating the presentation of the information on multiple screens, over many types of networks and devices. If it feels overwhelming to you(I felt it strongly, and I gave up. Then learnt how not to give up). When you find all these complicated, then change the book, course or the teacher. Keep finding ways to learn one new thing every hour.</p>
 
<p>You have to continue your journey to master the Full Stack, or atleast the heart (JavaScript) and the brain (Python) keep that ultimate goal and start now. Have a great time.</p>
