Pyscript is written in Typescript with Tailspin CSS giving it the style. So in a way, pyscript cannot be said as different language. At the best, it is library or a module like other JS library.

The module is under continuous development. It is interesting to know that Pyodide is used to convert the python code, so the browser can read it is again a JS library.

Pyscript is JS. Better learn JS, I started the same before 4 months. I am really glad that I started. JS provides more flexibility when it comes to web dev, and distributed computing domains with help of nodeJs.
