    <h1>Lets shake up this question a bit, since there is more to D3 as a library now. Why?</h1>

    <p>Visit Observable and take a look for yourself‚Ä¶ </p>
    <p>Recent notebooks by M M Kamalraj (https://observablehq.com/@solverbot) </p>
    <p>Whether quick and dirty or deep and aesthetic, anyone can analyze the data online and then move on making more
        detailed visualizations. After working with Plotly, shiny or tableau one biggest downside is you need to have
        compiler environment for the code to compile. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>For D3, your browser (one ubiquitous application that every type of GUI enabled OS have) is all that is
            needed. I had been reviewing the earlier examples Mike Bostock‚Äôs Blocks - bl.ocks.org
            (https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) and Curran Kelleher‚Äôs Blocks - bl.ocks.org (https://bl.ocks.org/curran) had
            created. All they need is a browser. </li>
        <li>D3 is either packed with the visualisation, are sourced from the CDN. So no installation. The logic is
            programmed with JS. You have a visual that can talk to the audience fluently and spread itself like crazy.
            Like the below link‚Ä¶</li>
        <li>When you are working with tiny to huge datasets, it takes time to analyze the data and find what exactly to
            show, track and visualise. For that purpose D3 will be an horrible candidate. Don‚Äôt try it. Use Excel sheet
            or Observable for that step. </li>
        <li>Add in Figma: the collaborative interface design tool (https://www.figma.com/) to concept check your
            visualisation. Build your visualisation, one svg at a time and see how it might look. Then port it to D3.
            The plots created in observable and Popular Blocks - bl.ocks.org (http://bl.ocks.org) are very inspiring.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Is It Better to Rent or Buy? (Published 2018)
    (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) This visual solves the problem of
    deciding whether to rent or buy. Visually. Think what problem you are solving.
    </p>
    
    To wrap it up, if you know d3.js then there is little or no reason to use the other tools. D3 is like a simple
    ‚ÄúPencil‚Äù, you can draw every line or automate it to draw a million shapes. Other tools are there to abstract away
    the details and automate the shape creations. On top of all this, D3 is further abstracted with Vega and Vega-lite,
    which has excellent VScode extension üì¢ #2 Visual Studio Code Vega Viewer üìà
    (https://dev.to/tarasnovak/visual-studio-code-vega-viewer-5gi6) adding grammar of graphics framework to api design.
    It has gotten very easy to visualize and be creative. There could be challenges at the team and org level to change.
    At the end, if you can get the work done faster, by getting things done by your processor rather than clicking and
    pasting, then why not?
