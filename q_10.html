<h1>Programmers are humans, you are human so you can be a programmer.</h1> 

<p>I want to argue against the premise that, “Programmers need smartness”</p>
<p>Ingredients: Dumb neural nets program themselves by playing the game a 100 thousand times. So to be a programmer you need that secret sauce called ability to break problems into simple steps, perseverance and relentlessness.</p>
<p>Reciepe: Smartness or any other esoteric skill help to speed up your work and submit for testing. That can be done by networks of artificial neurons. You as a human should be aware of which data to use for training the neural net and which way to get the output. These don't need smartness</p>
<p>Imagination: Seeing your work change the real world is very satisfying and empowering. When you build and others use and enjoy, the happiness is different. Money cannot buy that or even your incentives don't come near that. When you imagine that happiness and work, then all the world's smartness won't stand the chance.</p>
<p>Everyone has this three aspects so everyone can be a programmer. Now get breaking the problems and start typing code.</p>
