    <h1>Answer is Yes.</h1>
    <p>
        But, I wouldn’t suggest to make the move to Data Science field.

        Start your own Business: If you are from Marketing then best direction would be to learn the Data Science
        process, understand the problems it can solve in detail, and then start your own business and hire engineers to
        do the programming and Data Science for your client. If a Musk, Brin, Page, Jobs, and Gates can do it, why not
        we? All these guys learnt to solve problems at very young age. We need to Learn to Problem Solve using Code… Too
        long But Read-on (TL: BR)

        DS is coding. Objective is to create math models, internal processes and systems that can increase revenue,
        productivity, profit for the company. The coding field is very vast, and considerable time is required to master
        the programming language, problem solving, data analysis concepts and data visualisation practices. Say, around
        6 to 8 months of full time practice. At your age, I am confident you can pick up programming and problem solving
        very easily.

        If you are passionate about programming, data acquisition, data visualisation and analysis then you can review
        the below page. Let me dive into some aspects of Data Science.

    <h1>Passion:</h1>
    <p>
        I am from a same background as you are. In addition, I am a mechanical engineer. I love working with computers,
        data, automating data visualisation and data acquisition so I started learning to code. It is all about the idea
        of helping others to solve the problem.
    </p>
    <h1>Speed & Automation :</h1>
    <p>
        Many like me have shifted to DS field, only to face the culture shock. The shock will be the speed at which one
        has to complete the code, test, error correct, test and deploy. Some companies have DevOps, automating this
        process. But in some, you may have to set it up using a vendor. And in some, you may have to code the entire
        automation pipeline, since they hired you…

        For that, you have to learn, perform and in parallel deliver…. The speed and automation aspect!!!
    </p>
    <h1>Algorithms:</h1>
    <p>
        Another aspect is the algorithms. DS is about problem solving better than your competitor. As a Data Scientist,
        our task will be to come up with algorithm that is better than competitor. On top of it, algorithm needs to be
        implemented efficiently to run on Data Pipeline. Algorithms have to execute in seconds, because the customers
        will move away if your solution is slow.
    </p>
    <h1>Mindset:</h1>
    <p>
        You will be surprised how many Mechanical Engineering best practices are used by software dev guys, but the
        speed with which they do it is mind blowing. When we enter Coding field from manufacturing, our mindset has to
        be tuned for the different way of working. Don’t underestimate the time it will take to change your own mindset…
        It will take more time than we estimate.
    </p>
    <h1>Real Projects:</h1>
    <p>
        Many times the companies ask for the real project experience during the interview process. There are many sites,
        services that can help you creating the projects. They are still toy projects at the best. The real software
        development involves lot more than just creating the models, and needs many different team members.

        It is same like in manufacturing. Any one can make a shaft using a lathe, but there has to be a quality engineer
        doing the testing for lot after lot, and providing the report. When you learn coding, you can think of new ideas
        to bring the manufacturing the data science world together. That is where starting your own business will come
        into picture. If you have idea that you can market, then why work for someone else???

        Please feel free to DM me or comment below. I am fellow learner like you. I can share my understanding and
        knowledge. Others non-programmers thinking about making the shift can also understand the challenge better
        before entering the field.
