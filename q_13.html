<body><h1>Start by asking,</h1> 

How can I automate the work that I am doing now? Charles Babbage asked this question and invented the Mechanical Computer. Computers automate Arithmetic and Logic operation that we humans find monotonous.

<h1>Your Company as a Computer: (Analogy)</h1>
<p>
Look at your current work, and list down the activities or steps you do on hourly, daily and monthly basis. You will see a pattern, repetition of steps. That is what managers and analysts look for, and find ways to improve efficiency, create value and finally profit for the organization. In a sense, management is “Programming the Company”. The workers / executives are executing the logical steps or commands.
</p>

<h1>Answer:</h1>
<p>
Decide to automate one part of your job. Yes, it could be any part. Do research on problems, python libraries and case studies on existing automation solutions. You will be surprised at the treasure trove of info in Google. There are so many research going on already, and the results and tutorials are shared.

In parallel learn Python Programming basics. Python is like our English language in which certain “Keywords” have powers to make the processor work. Learn those powers and master them.

You will like to learn python fast, if you follow the above route. (Motivation is all that matters) Have a great time learning. Because it is going to be tough.
