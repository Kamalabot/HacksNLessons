<h1>D3 brings data and HTML documents together</h1>

<p> By using declarative programming. It gives very detail control of DOM of your HTML page. Its like building the
    entire webgage by programming it. Yes, that is what D3 does.

    Above link you can see how the alphabets are dynamically changing. These are just text, and D3 can position them in
    the way you want. That is very powerful. With such a power, you also learn HTML and CSS in supercharged way. Because
    that is what D3 creates, so you have to know about these tech ahead of time.
    Then there is Vega and Vega lite if you are not ready to go in detail about the DOM and live with more abstraction.
    These libraries can reduce the amout of program you write. Still get the best looking visuals.

    Its more important now to learn libraries like D3. Much of the work can be easily abstracted by libraries, then how
    you will contribute as a programmer? Your skillset must include problem solving through code. In case of D3 you will
    solve visual problems. If you can master that, and algorithms behind it, that will be a huge boost to your
    productivity and employability.

    Python Data Science Libraries (https://kamalabot.github.io/M3nD3/pythonlibraries.html)
    Here is one unfinished example where I am building the webpage by using the dataset and d3 libraries. That page has
    the supporting program executed directly on the browser and takes the data from the root directory. All this from a
    static web hosting on github pages.

    I am inspired by Mike Bostocks many examples and writings that you can find here. His take on software as building
    block and making it a tool for achieveing the best results possible.

    After learning tools starting with Matplotlib, seaborn and plotly then I finally decided to give D3 a shot. Its well
    worth it. Altair library in python is also ported as api from D3. So knowing D3 is like knowing a new programming
    language. Go for it. Happy programming
