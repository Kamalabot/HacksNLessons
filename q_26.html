There is really no danger in the first place.

<p>The websites and the browser together doesn't let you to run JS that easily. There are exceptions to this, but all mainstream sites fall under this category.</p>

<p>For example, quora answers page will load with set of libraries it needs. You can see this by opening the developer tools in your browser, and checking the elements tab. There you use Ctrl+f shortcut and search for “script” tag. You will see many scripts. </p>

<p>There are security in place that stops the execution, if there is new script or conflicting actions taken. The sites that are in use, like bank sites, Social network and Ecom sites depends on many frameworks that need specific environment to work. So any code injection on the browser will trigger multiple errors. </p>

<p>Just relax. At the moment browser is the interface to the internet and its resources. Many hackers are working round the clock to both test and develop secure environment. </p>

<p>All you need care about is what you consume from the things your secure browser shows, and shares(pun intended)</p>
