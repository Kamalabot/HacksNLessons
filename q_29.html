<h1>Mastering JS can be divided into multiple levels.</h1> 
<p>
Level one is to get the logic, regex and looping concept mastery. Next is Async and Await mastery, which is more trickier than it looks. Next is Object oriented concepts. Finally there is the concept of accessor function and closures mastery. 
</p>
<p>
Much of the programs written by others will involve the closures, accessors and async and await programming. Also they would have learnt a lot more about the related technologies that are depend on JS, HTML and CSS. 
</p>
<p>
That is where the Document Object Model comes into picture. JS has lot of ways to control the DOM elements. There are many supporting libraries that make life much easier for developing with Js. Mastery in Front end is possible after mastering JS. So don't jump into Front End without proper study.
</p>
<p>
I mastered each level by solving lot of examples and working out the logic of other programmers. I used many free resources to practice. I am still intermediate at best.
